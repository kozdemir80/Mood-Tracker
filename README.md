MoodTracker app
MoodTracker is majorly inspired by Mr. Mood for iOS. The idea is simple: every day, you record your mood within the application. if you want, you can add a note to give more information on why you're feeling a certain way (ex. "I got a new job!" or "There was no cheesecake left for dessert"). 

Your mood history is saved for a week, allowing you see your general mood trends. Any comment you've left can also be consulted.

Project brief
The MoodTracker homepage shows, by default, a happy face (shown with a smiley : )in full screen. Users have the choice between 5 different moods:

: ( - Really bad mood. You didn't sleep well, were awakened by your neighbor's rooster, and your car broke down on the way to work.
: / - Bad mood. It's raining, and you forgot your umbrella.
: | - Decent mood. Nothing special to report.
: ) - Good mood. It's Saturday, the weather's nice, and you slept well.
: D - Great mood! You won the lottery, and your favorite celebrity accepted your invitation to prom.
By sliding towards the top, or in other words, by sliding your finger from the bottom to the top of the screen (you can also use your nose, that works, too), you'll show the next mood, which is happier. By sliding towards the bottom, you'll show the previous mood, which is less happy.  Each mood has a different background color.
